### mp
mp is short for "multiplayer", it tweaks the multiplayer options.
If you do "mp e" it will enable multiplayer and if you do "mp d" it will disable it

**Errors during execution**
"mp e" will fail if you have an outdated version of the game. This is to prevent exploits found in older versions which may be fixed from being used. Yes, you can edit the file in ``GAME_DIRECTORY/.tmp/multiplayerCache.json`` but there are protections from the server itself which blocks outdated clients, a server owner may tweak these permsissions to essentially create a "cracked" server.
