### The .tmp/ directory
The game will automatically make a ``.tmp/`` directory if one does not exist, although the name is misleading ``.tmp/`` stores all of your game data such as your servers and if you are playing on singleplayer, your stats. Its a bit like the ``.minecraft/`` in the game Minecraft. Unless you want to reset your progress, I suggest you do not remove or edit the .tmp/ directory. The game will automatically remove un-needed temporarily files on a successful shutdown so there is no need for you to remove it.
